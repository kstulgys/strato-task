## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
bun dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
bun build
```

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `bun build`
